            <h1>IMPORTANT</h1>
            <p>You just fell for a fake 'scam email'. A scam - in the context of this text - is a digital resource, made to imitate another, with the result that the creator may earn money off the unsuspecting victim. Had it've been a real scam, it would have been quite probable that you were about to lose a small (or possibly larger) sum of money. Read on to learn how to avoid these kind of scams and to stay safe on the internet.</p>
            <h2>Part 1: Scams</h2>
            <h3>Detecting Scams</h3><p>Most often, scams will have grammar issues in them, or will not be formatted very well. This is the first indicator of something suspicious. The next indicator will be that it is informing of an issue concerning a service (e.g., a parcel could not be delivered, or your Amazon account is being suspended). These alone are not suspicious, unless it want's you to pay some form of fee. Take some time to read the email and think "Is this logical?". For instance, is it asking you to ring Microsoft using a phone number? If so, is that phone number a proper bussiness phone numebr from the USA (or perhaps an international call centre), or is it a normal phone number? One last thing to check for. If you are on a website, check the URL, or Universal Resource Locator. Does it look like it is owned by a company, or is it <span>https://auspost-postal-fee.com/</span>. It should be a subdomain of <span>https://auspost.com.au/</span> and have the .au extension.</p>
            <h3>Avoiding Scams</h3><p>Now you may say "This is all very well and good, but how can I avoid them in the first place?". The answer to this, depends on what you want to avoid. Most email platforms are smart enough to filter junk emails into the junk section. You can turn this on using the settings. Whenever you go to a website, check if it uses the HTTP or the HTTPS ptotocol. You should not input passwords or personal details to HTTP sites.</p>
            <h3>After Scams</h3><p>Four words: Call your bank, now!</p>
            <h2>Part 2: In General</h2>
